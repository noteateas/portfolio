			<article class="travel travel2">
				<p>"Everything is engulfed in darkness by nightfall.<br/> The dappled light from the endless sea of stars is just enough<br/> to make out the shapes of sleeping bodies,<br/> joined together under rugs and blankets.<br/> A family of nine herders, now completely still. <br/>Colourful prayer mats stitched with patterns of fruit,<br/> mosques and their favourite football teams lay underneath them<br/>but do little to stop the the warm earth beneath. <br/>A pile of charcoal burns to its last breath, a relic of the last pot of tea<br/> boiled and the final exchanges before bed.<br/> As the moon crosses the sky and the horizon begins to glow,<br/> the horned beasts awake."</p><br/>

				<p>During the year, rain falls for two or three months, but in some years and in some areas, there can be none whatsoever. Over the last half a century, the Sahel has faced the most severe and long enduring drought events than anywhere else on the planet. Now, the region faces its greatest challenge to date; erratic rainfall and increasing desertification at the onset of climate change, where the Sahara is advancing in many cases by 10km every year. For pastoral, agricultural and nomadic communities in the Sahel, the risk of resource scarcity is one which also brings a likelihood of severe famine, instability, conflict and forced migration.</p>

				<p>"They are not like you or I.<br/> 
				They don't hear the eerie silence beneath the surface. <br/> 
				Nor do they feel disorientated by the layers that swirl with every movement. <br/> 
				They don't panic, or gasp for air when they're lungs have reached their limit. <br/>
				Instead, it is like a delicate performance, <br/>whereby shadows pirouette beneath a dim light seeping up through the surface.<br/>When I close my eyes and concentrate on nothing else, I start to hear it too.<br/>
				Pulsing networks, invisible currents, life carried through ebbs and flows. <br/> 
				It communicates with every sense in overdrive. <br/>
				A feeling that is as spiritual as it is physical, from the symbiotic connection between man<br/>  and the wide expanse of water that most of us know so little about. <br/>The discourse of their whole lives revolve around a connection with the ocean; their livelihoods, their fate, their survival."</p>
				<div class="over fish2"></div>
				<div class="over fish1"></div>
				<p>Whether comparing the stories of the families met in Malaysia or Indonesia, the same underpinning principle applies: that Bajau culture, knowledge and insight of the world is neither recognised or integrated into the vastly changing, fragile modern world.<br/>
				Their segregation and autonomy, both politically and socially, has meant that the majority of Bajau people are forced to live the life they’ve been given for generations; a life at sea.As a result of being historically ingrained in a complex poverty cycle, the Bajau are not agents of change. They cannot diversify their livelihoods, nor do they have the assets to alleviate themselves from this poverty cycle.
				At the onset of even greater adversity from climate change in the coming years, they are presented with few options to adapt and overcome the fragility of their own circumstance without intervention and support.</p>
